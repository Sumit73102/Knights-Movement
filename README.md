# Knights-Moveme
A UI design that takes the position of a Knight as an input on an 8x8
chessboard via mouse click on chess board and finds all the possible places where the Knight can
move assuming that there are no pieces of the opposite color and hence no
blocks.

This project is completely based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
